These code sample documents were made as a part of a teaching assistantship of the OOP UABC course for the 4th semester, summarizing the last 3 units. All the theory involved in these documents came from different sources, such as forums, articles, books and many more.

The topics covered in each unit are organized with a theoretical introduction following an example statement to the problem, an example code with its proper execution of the program and conclusions.
